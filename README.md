## Dataset

<img src="figures/dataset_tensors.png" width="500"/>
This figure shows the images of the real CRC polyp types as well as the fabricated phantoms replicating them. These polyps are classified based on Kudo pit patterns, such as Asteroid, Gyrus, Round, and Oval. Also, a conceptual three-dimensional illustration of the textural image dataset collected by the HySenSe VTS on  10 variations of 3D printed polyp phantoms is shown in the figure.  Each of the polyp phantoms is printed with 4 different materials (i.e., DM-400, DM-600, A-40, and A-70).

## Experimental Setup

<img src="figures/exp_setup.png" width="500"/>
This figure shows the experimental setup for collecting textural images using the HyySense VTS and polyp phantoms, including: \textcircled{1}: CRC polyp phantoms, \textcircled{2}: Mark-10 Series 5 Digital Force Gauge, \textcircled{3}: M-UMR12.40 Precision Linear Stage, \textcircled{4}: HySenSe sensor, \textcircled{5}: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, \textcircled{6}: HySenSe image output, \textcircled{7}: Dimensions of polyp phantom, \textcircled{8}: HySenSe side view, top view, and dimensions, $h_s$ = 24 mm is the height of the 3D printed rigid frame, $t_s$ = 4.5 mm is the thickness of the gel layer $w_s$ = 33.8 mm is the width of the gel layer, and R = 35 mm is the radius of the dome-shaped gel layer.
